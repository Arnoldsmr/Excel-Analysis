# Crowdfunding Data Analysis Readme
## Overview
In this project, I have conducted a comprehensive analysis of crowdfunding data provided by edX Boot Camps LLC. The goal was to uncover market trends, evaluate campaign success, and provide insights into crowdfunding dynamics.

## Conditional Formatting
I applied conditional formatting to the "Outcome" column to visually distinguish successful, failed, canceled, and live campaigns. Each outcome category is represented by a distinct color, aiding in quick data interpretation. Additionally, I utilized conditional formatting for the "Percent Funded" column, employing a three-color scale from dark red to green to blue to indicate the level of funding achievement relative to the initial goal.

## Column Creation
I successfully created six new columns as per the assignment requirements:

Percent Funded: Calculated the percentage of funding achieved relative to the initial goal.
Average Donation: Determined the average amount contributed by each project backer.
Parent Category and Sub-Category: Split the existing "Category" and "Sub-Category" columns into separate entities.
Date Created Conversion: Converted Unix timestamps in the "launched_at" column into Excel's date format.
Date Ended Conversion: Converted Unix timestamps in the "deadline" column into Excel's date format.
<b>Pivot</B> Tables and Stacked Column Charts
I created pivot tables and visualizations to analyze campaign outcomes per category and sub-category. Additionally, I developed stacked column pivot charts that can be filtered by country, providing a comprehensive view of campaign performance across different regions.

## Crowdfunding Goal Analysis
I conducted an in-depth analysis of crowdfunding goals, categorizing projects into different goal ranges and calculating the success, failure, and cancellation rates for each range. A line chart was created to visualize the relationship between goal amounts and campaign outcomes, offering valuable insights into the impact of funding goals on project success.

## Statistical Analysis
I performed statistical analysis on the number of campaign backers for both successful and unsuccessful campaigns. Calculations including mean, median, minimum, maximum, variance, and standard deviation were conducted to understand the distribution and variability of backers. A compelling justification was provided to determine whether the mean or median better summarizes the data, along with insights into the variability of successful and unsuccessful campaigns.

## Written Report
I compiled a comprehensive report in Microsoft Word, addressing key questions such as conclusions drawn from the data, limitations of the dataset, and suggestions for additional tables or graphs to enhance analysis. The report presents a cohesive analysis of the crowdfunding data, providing valuable insights for stakeholders.

Overall, this analysis offers a detailed understanding of crowdfunding dynamics and market trends, facilitating informed decision-making for future campaigns.
